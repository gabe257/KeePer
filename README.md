  In the past 4 years, the EA Sports soccer video game, FIFA, has become the top sports game in the world; every minute, over five-thousand FIFA matches are started globally. The simple-to-learn-but-difficult-to-master soccer simulator has gripped tens of millions of young adults across the country with it's competetive player vs. player matchups. Unfortunately, no mechanism exists by which users can record their match results with their friends. 
 
  KeePer is a mobile app which makes it easy to enter and save match results and stats. Users can see their match record vs. their friends via an infographic showing goals, shots, tackles, teams used, etc. Each user has his/her own account which automatically uploads their data, storing it both locally and on the cloud.
